Movies.
</h1>

- ``8th June 2019``.
> This is a mini **project** that I have been wanting to do for a while now. The aim of the project is to allow users to know the latest movies out there, watch movie trailers and read reviews on their favourite movies. I would also like to add a registration and login page to the site so that users can have their own profile pages and manage their favourite movies.

- The aim is to user the ``movie database api`` for this application and hopefully, by the ain of the project, I should have something like this.

 Challenges.
</h4>

- The first challenge I faced in this project was getting ``travis`` to turn ‚úÖ after I implemented the function to fetch data from the ``movie db api``. For some reason the build was alsways timing out.

  - After a bit of research, I realised that I to called the ``done()`` method in my test to tell ``mocha`` to wait until the promise has been resolved.

 ```javascript
    describe('GET /', ()=>{
  it('responds with a json object', (done)=>{
    request(app)
    .get('/')
    .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
    .expect(200)
    .end((err, res)=>{
      if(err){
        return done(err)
      }
      done()
    });
  });
});
```

  How to Use App.
</h4>

- ``Fork`` and ``clone`` this repo.
- open ``terminal`` and cd into ``movies``.
- ``run bundle install``

Updates.
</h4>

 ``15th June ``.
> I finally got time today to work on the  movie app and I must say that I have learnt a lot. This is how the app currently looks now. I still have a long way to go to I am happy with the prgress.

<img width="1278" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-15 at 21 08 52" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37377831/59555923-7b792b80-8fb2-11e9-9330-d0d9ea3a96ed.png">

> The next step is to add a show page. This page will ``render`` each individual ``movie`` and give more information about it.

- Today, I also learnt about how to ``mock`` api calls when ``testing`` using ``jest spyOn``. This allowed me to test the ``App`` component without making an actual ``api`` call.


```javascript

  it('fetches data from the server when component mounts', (done)=>{
    const mockedResponse = {"page": 1, "total_results": 19840,};

    const mockJsonPromise = Promise.resolve(mockedResponse),
          mockFetchPromise = Promise.resolve({
            json: ()=> mockJsonPromise
          });

    jest.spyOn(global, 'fetch').mockImplementation(()=> mockFetchPromise);

    const wrapper = shallow(< App/>);

    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
    expect(global.fetch).toHaveBeenCalledWith('/api/movies/popular/movies');

    process.nextTick(() => {
      expect(wrapper.find('Nav')).toBeTruthy();
      global.fetch.mockClear()
      done();
    });
    done();
  });

```
> The done() method is passed to the ``it`` block to tell jest to wait until the async funtion, ``fetch``,is completed before the test ends.

``16th june 2019``.

- I wrote a ``test`` for my custom ``404 page``.
- Implemented a custom 404 page to the application.
>  I did this even though, I said i wanted to add a show page.``üòù``.
- This is the custom page curretly looks.

> Now unto what, I said I was gonna do for today, add a show page.


``22th june 2019``.

- A lot has changed since the last time I worked on the application.
- I have added routes to the app using ``react-routers``.
- This is how the app currently looks.

- when a user cliks on an movie, the user is taken to a show page.

> The idea behind the show page is to give users information on a selected movie.

<h4 align='center'>
Learning.
</h4>

- I learnt how to pass props to react routers using ``render`` instead of ``component``. **[More Info Here](https://blog.bitsrc.io/must-know-concepts-of-react-router-fb9c8cc3c12)**.

<h4 align='center'>
To Dos.
</h4>

- Add links to Navigation Bar. (done)

``24th June 2019``

- Here is how the app is currently looking.

<img width="960" alt="Screen Shot 2019-06-24 at 18 26 53" src="https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37377831/60039194-0f7f7d00-96ae-11e9-87ae-6860981f0859.png">


- I added navigation links , login and signup button to the app.
  - The next step is to add a 404 page to the client side.
  - Then add the ability for a user to sign up and log in.
  - Implement pagination.
