Movies.
</h1>

- ``8th June 2019``.
> This is a mini **project** that I have been wanting to do for a while now. The aim of the project is to allow users to know the latest movies out there, watch movie trailers and read reviews on their favourite movies. I would also like to add a registration and login page to the site so that users can have their own profile pages and manage their favourite movies.

- The aim is to user the ``movie database api`` for this application and hopefully, by the ain of the project, I should have something like this.

 Challenges.
</h4>

- The first challenge I faced in this project was getting ``travis`` to turn âœ… after I implemented the function to fetch data from the ``movie db api``. For some reason the build was alsways timing out.

  - After a bit of research, I realised that I to called the ``done()`` method in my test to tell ``mocha`` to wait until the promise has been resolved.

 ```javascript
    describe('GET /', ()=>{
  it('responds with a json object', (done)=>{
    request(app)
    .get('/')
    .expect('Content-Type', /json/)
    .expect(200)
    .end((err, res)=>{
      if(err){
        return done(err)
      }
      done()
    });
  });
});
```
